Great job!

For the Problem 1.c, the mean needs to be calculated using the turn_busts with money less than 0.

Great job! 

For the first problem the function "end" has a condition
```
if(bankroll==0) break
```
It would be better to modify it to
```
if(bankroll<=0) break
```

Great job!
For the problem 2, you have not answered the question.

Great job!
It would be better to define different names for each simulation function in Problem 1

For problem 2, it would be better to use **p=18/38** in binomial for the simulation

It would be faster if you can use **apply** function to the whole bootstrapping data in **boot_cl** function.
